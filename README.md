* Built using React library.
* Uses redux to manage global store and in conjuction with thunk to persist user info.
* Custom Bootstrap is used to provide some design elements.

## How to run

You need to have Node.js installed. 
The app uses REST API that was created in the previous phase - https://github.com/Itsanexpriment/Coupon-system---Spring-framework.
It is possible (and easy) to change the server api, there are no dependencies between client and server.
